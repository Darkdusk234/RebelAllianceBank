# Rebel Alliance Bank  

## Description  
Rebel Alliance Bank is an internet bank designed to provide customers with a seamless and user-friendly platform to manage their day-to-day finances.  

The application enables:  
- Effortless money transfers, either between your own accounts or to external accounts.  
- Taking out loans or repaying existing loans.  

Built with C#, the application offers a structured and scalable foundation, making it easier to implement future enhancements. While the application is functional, some bugs may still be present; we are committed to addressing these in upcoming patches.  

### Planned Features  
We aim to implement the following features in future updates:  
- A transaction queue system to introduce a slight delay (e.g., a few minutes) for processing transfers.  
- Two-factor authentication to enhance security.  
- Transaction history for detailed tracking of all operations.  
- Hidden password fields for added privacy during login.  
- And much more!
